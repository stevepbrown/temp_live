# temp_live


At the time this repository was created the master branch of the other / main repo for the corporate website does not reflect that which is deployed. This is undesireable, bad practice, but there you go! Use this repo to get a copy of the deployed application into version control. When the minor changes have been implemented , deploy it in a draft environment, then live. 

Retain this repo only as long as the 'true' repo has an undeployable master. As soon as this is remedied, ditch this branch!
